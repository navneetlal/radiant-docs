# Typography

We use [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as the sole typeface across marketing or branding materials. For product design, it is paired with another family [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro).

Poppins makes an excellent font for titles and headlines and can also serve as the body font for small text blocks or text blocks which have large font sizes. However, Source Sans Pro is reserved for any body copy while designing user interfaces.

Poppins, created by Indian Type Foundry, is a geometric sans-serif with a fairly high x-height. It supports both Latin and Devanagari character sets. Poppinsâ€™s letters are practically monolinear, having vertical and horizontal strokes of the same visual weight, although optical corrections have been applied to stroke joints where necessary, to maintain an even colour in text.

The Poppins family includes 9 weights, from Thin through Black. It has a huge collection of 18 styles for a varied use.

Source Sans Pro is a san serif typeface that was developed by Paul D. Hunt on behalf of Adobe, and contributed to Google Fonts. It has good readability in smaller sizes.

The Source Sans Pro family includes 6 weights, from Extra-Light to Black, with 12 styles.
